PSOTFIX EVALUATOR

Project description:

Functions Used in the code:
1)Header Files:

#include <stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like printf (for printing output) and scanf (for reading input).

#include <ctype.h>: This header provides functions for character testing, such as isalpha (checks if a character is an alphabet) and isdigit (checks if a character is a digit).

#include <stdlib.h>: This header includes general utility functions, although it's not directly used in the provided snippet. It's often included for functions like malloc, free, etc.

2) Macros and Global Variables:

#define MAX 100: This preprocessor directive defines a constant MAX with a value of 100. This is likely the maximum size of the stack used in the program.

int top = -1;: This declares a global integer variable top and initializes it to -1. This variable acts as the index of the top element in the stack. A value of -1 indicates that the stack is currently empty.

int stk[MAX];: This declares a global integer array named stk of size MAX. This array will be used to implement the stack data structure.

3)Push And Pop function's

Push function is used to push element in to the stack.

pop function is used to the pop the element from the stack.

Required Tool's:Dev c++
